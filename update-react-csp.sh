echo "  ‚Ä¢ Overrides XMLHttpRequest to upgrade HTTP to HTTPS"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Provides utility functions for CSP management"

echo "  ‚Ä¢ Prevents mixed content warnings"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Works with all fetch() and XMLHttpRequest calls"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ No code changes needed in individual components"

echo "üìã How it works:"
echo "  1. App.jsx initializes CSP hook"
echo "  2. CSP hook adds meta tag to document head"
echo "  3. CSP hook overrides fetch() and XMLHttpRequest"
echo "  4. All HTTP requests automatically upgraded to HTTPS"
echo "  5. API config also checks CSP and upgrades URLs"

echo "üìã Benefits:"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ No mixed content errors"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Better security"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Improved user experience"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Works with existing code without changes"

echo "üîß Testing CSP Implementation:"
echo "----------------------------"
echo ""
echo "1. Start the development server:"
echo "   cd frontend && npm run dev"
echo ""
echo "2. Open browser console and check for:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ 'CSP meta tag added dynamically'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ 'CSP: Upgraded HTTP to HTTPS' messages"
echo ""
echo "3. Test API calls:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Navigate to pages that use API"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Check Network tab for HTTPS requests"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Verify no mixed content warnings"

echo ""
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Important Notes:"
echo "------------------"
echo "‚Ä¢ CSP will only upgrade HTTP to HTTPS if the target supports HTTPS"
echo "‚Ä¢ If your API doesn't support HTTPS, you'll need to configure SSL"
echo "‚Ä¢ Test thoroughly in different browsers"
echo "‚Ä¢ Monitor console for any CSP violations"
